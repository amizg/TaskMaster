## Features - v1.0
- Task Master is a task management application
- Separation of Tasks in "Category Cards" ( Work, Home, School, etc.)
- Set "Routines", Tasks that recur automatically on specified days.
- Set a deadline for a task to be completed (File Taxes, Homework Assignment, etc.)
- Set a deadline for a routine task to cease recurring (Last day of a class, Last day of training, etc.)
- Routines Page for editing and viewing Routines when not present on Category Card
- View all tasks specific to the day ahead with "Day at a Glance" (Deadlined tasks, routine tasks for that day)
- Clear completed tasks on that specific card only with option in 3 dot menu on Card
- Clear all completed tasks on all cards with the button on the home menu
- App Theme will match the phone theme (Dark/Light)

<br/>

## Notes
- Currently there is not a way to set a routine to recur at certain times or dates
    - Recommended Actions: Specify the time in the description of the routine
    - Only specify a deadline for a routine task with the intention of that being the final day of that recurrence
- Clear Completed Tasks will permanently delete any task that is marked as complete
    - Currently, recurring Routine tasks will not clear from the card, even when completed
    - Recommended Actions: If you wish to PERMANENTLY delete a Routine task, you must manually delete it in the task details menu
    - The Routine task will move to the bottom of the card when completed, and mark itself incomplete again on the next scheduled day
    - If the routine task has a finish deadline, it will delete after it is completed and after the deadline is reached
- Tasks created without a deadline or repeating days will appear on the card everyday until it is completed and cleared.
    - These tasks will not appear on the Day at a Glance

<br/>

## Plans for the future

- Routines
    - Routines tasks to have set times and dates to recur
    - Clear from card view when completed without permanently deleting from data
    - Allow for more variety in recurrence options (bi-weekly, weekly, monthly, etc)
    - Show Routine repeated days under task description, before expanding the task view
- Cards 
    - Allow for options to show tasks on cards for the day, 3 days, week, etc. based on use preference
    - Show the names of neighbor cards
    - Improve speed of task refresh on card scroll
